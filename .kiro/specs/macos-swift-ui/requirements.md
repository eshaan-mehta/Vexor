# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a native macOS application using Swift and SwiftUI that provides a fast, responsive user interface for the existing Python-based file search backend. The application will establish efficient inter-process communication to minimize latency between user queries and search results, while maintaining the existing backend's functionality for indexing and searching files.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want a native macOS application with a clean search interface, so that I can quickly search through my indexed files without using a command-line interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application launches THEN the system SHALL display a native macOS window with a search input field
2. WHEN the user types in the search field THEN the system SHALL provide real-time search suggestions with minimal latency
3. WHEN the user presses Enter or clicks search THEN the system SHALL display search results in a structured list format
4. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL show file name, path, relevance score, and file type for each result
5. WHEN the user clicks on a search result THEN the system SHALL open the file using the default macOS application

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want search results to appear instantly as I type, so that I can quickly find and open files like Spotlight search.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user types in the search field THEN the system SHALL show live search results with each keystroke
2. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL limit results to a maximum of 10 files for quick scanning
3. WHEN search results are ready THEN the system SHALL update the UI within 100ms of typing
4. WHEN multiple keystrokes occur rapidly THEN the system SHALL debounce requests and cancel outdated searches
5. WHEN the user presses Enter or clicks on the top result THEN the system SHALL immediately open that file

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to automatically connect to my existing file indexing backend, so that I don't need to manually configure connections or duplicate my indexed data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and connect to the running Python backend
2. IF no backend is running THEN the system SHALL attempt to start the backend process automatically
3. WHEN the backend connection is established THEN the system SHALL display connection status in the UI
4. WHEN the backend is indexing files THEN the system SHALL show indexing progress and status
5. IF the backend connection is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to quickly navigate and open files using keyboard shortcuts, so that I can maintain a fast workflow similar to Spotlight.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL highlight the top result by default
2. WHEN the user presses arrow keys THEN the system SHALL navigate between the displayed results
3. WHEN the user presses Enter THEN the system SHALL open the currently selected file
4. WHEN the user presses Cmd+Enter THEN the system SHALL reveal the file in Finder
5. WHEN the user presses Escape THEN the system SHALL clear the search and hide results

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Swift UI to communicate efficiently with the Python backend, so that the system maintains high performance and reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN establishing communication THEN the system SHALL use a high-performance IPC mechanism (Unix domain sockets or HTTP with keep-alive)
2. WHEN sending search requests THEN the system SHALL serialize queries efficiently using JSON
3. WHEN receiving search results THEN the system SHALL deserialize responses on a background thread to avoid UI blocking
4. WHEN the backend is busy THEN the system SHALL queue requests and handle them asynchronously
5. IF communication errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backend to use a unified queue-based multi-threaded architecture for all file processing, so that indexing is fast, responsive, and can handle both initial indexing and real-time file changes through a single processing pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend starts THEN the system SHALL initialize a single thread-safe queue (using Python's queue.Queue) that handles all file processing tasks
2. WHEN the backend starts THEN the system SHALL immediately start the file watcher on a separate dedicated thread before beginning directory traversal
3. WHEN directory indexing begins THEN the system SHALL traverse the directory tree and add all discovered files to the shared processing queue without processing them immediately
4. WHEN the file watcher detects file changes (create/modify/move/delete) THEN the system SHALL add these files to the same processing queue immediately
5. WHEN files are queued THEN the system SHALL spawn configurable worker threads (default 4) to process files in parallel by pulling from the shared queue
6. WHEN a worker thread processes a file THEN the system SHALL index the file and commit to the database using individual atomic transactions
7. WHEN multiple threads access the database THEN the system SHALL ensure thread-safe database operations without race conditions
8. WHEN indexing is in progress THEN the system SHALL provide real-time progress updates based on queue size and files processed count
9. WHEN the queue is empty THEN the system SHALL continue running with file watcher active for real-time file change detection
10. WHEN the system shuts down THEN the system SHALL gracefully stop all worker threads and complete any in-progress file processing

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to specify which directory to index when I first launch (also later on in the app settings in) the application, so that I can search through my own files rather than a hardcoded test directory.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application launches for the first time THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to select a root directory for indexing
2. WHEN the user selects a directory THEN the system SHALL validate that the directory exists and is readable
3. WHEN a valid directory is selected THEN the system SHALL save this preference and start the indexing process
4. WHEN indexing begins THEN the system SHALL display progress information including current file being processed and total progress
5. WHEN the application launches on subsequent runs THEN the system SHALL use the previously selected directory without prompting
6. WHEN the user wants to change the indexed directory THEN the system SHALL provide a settings option to select a new root directory
7. WHEN a new directory is selected THEN the system SHALL clear the existing index and rebuild it with the new directory

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to provide accessibility features and integrate well with macOS, so that it works with assistive technologies and feels native.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL provide visible focus indicators
2. WHEN the application launches THEN the system SHALL integrate with macOS menu bar or dock appropriately
3. WHEN the application is backgrounded THEN the system SHALL maintain minimal resource usage
4. WHEN files are opened THEN the system SHALL use macOS default applications and respect user preferences
