Zyphor-7 is a twilight world orbiting a dying crimson star, its sky painted in perpetual hues of deep purple and ember-orange.
Towering bioluminescent fungi replace trees, pulsing with eerie green light, while rivers of liquid methane carve glowing veins through the obsidian terrain.
The air is thick with swirling luminescent spores, drifting lazily in the planet's weak gravity.
Strange, insectoid creatures with chitinous wings hum through the shadows, their multifaceted eyes reflecting the dim glow of the fungal forests.
Beneath the surface, vast underground caverns teem with eyeless predators, lurking in the phosphorescent depths, waiting for the unwary to stray too far.
