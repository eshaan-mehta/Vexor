Immediate
1 after indexing, only leave one indexing thread running
4 index files using file hash
5 split file into smaller chunks for storage and more granular search
7 create ui for mac similar to spotlight search

Improvements (Later)
- what happens if a worker takes a file to index but fails.
- ability to skip directories (user can set directories to omit alongside )


Testing
- ensure indexing doesnt' take to long since a file could change/be 
added in the mean time and it would be out of sync
- test indexing large files
- test file hash
