Immediate
- don't index files on move, just update metadata (don't create duplicate)
- don't index files if they haven't changed since the last time
- search ranking weightedly
- test search and indexing quality
- change normalize cosine weights for metadata and content
- index answers using file hash
- handle more than just .txt files


Improvements
- put search and indexing workers on background processes/threads
- split file into smaller chunks for storage and more granular search
- create ui
- batch update db to save time on indexing (save last batch index incase of failure)
