Immediate
4 index files using file hash
5 split file into smaller chunks for storage and more granular search
6 put search workers on background processes/threads
7 create ui for mac similar to spotlight search


Improvements (Later)
1 batch update db to save time on indexing (save last batch index incase of failure)


Testing
- test indexing large files
- test file hash
- test file split
- test file search with no results
