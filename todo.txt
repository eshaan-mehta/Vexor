Immediate
- don't index files on move, just update metadata (don't create duplicate)
- put initial indexing on background thread
- search ranking weightedly
- index answers using file hash
- on delete doesn't work


Improvements
- put search and indexing workers on background processes/threads
- split file into smaller chunks for storage and more granular search
- create ui
- batch update db to save time on indexing (save last batch index incase of failure)
